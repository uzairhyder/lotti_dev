            outlines our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage your Personal Information.
            We have adopted the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the
            Privacy Act). The NPPs govern the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure and dispose of your
            Personal Information.
            A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the Australian
            Information Commissioner at www.aoic.gov.au
            What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?
            Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of Personal
            Information we collect include names, addresses, email addresses, phone and facsimile numbers.
            This Personal Information is obtained in many ways including correspondence, by email, via our website
            www.energy4living.com.au and from third parties. We don’t guarantee website links or policy of authorised
            third parties.
            We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you, providing
            information to our clients and marketing. We may also use your Personal Information for secondary purposes
            closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances where you would reasonably expect such use or
            disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our mailing/marketing lists at any time by contacting us in writing.
            When we collect Personal Information, we will, where appropriate and where possible, explain to you why we
            are collecting the information and how we plan to use it.
            Sensitive Information
            Sensitive information is defined in the Privacy Act to include information or opinion about such things as
            an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association,
            religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal record
            or health information.


            Sensitive information will be used by us only:
            • For the primary purpose for which it was obtained
            • For a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose
            • With your consent; or where required or authorised by law.
            Third Parties
            Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from you. However,
            in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third parties. In such a case we will take
            reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the information provided to us by the third party.
            Disclosure of Personal Information
            Your Personal Information may be disclosed in a number of circumstances including the following:
            • Third parties where you consent to the use or disclosure; and
            • Where required or authorised by law.
            Security of Personal Information
            Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse and loss and from
            unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.
            When your Personal Information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was obtained, we will take
            reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal Information. However, most of the
            Personal Information is or will be stored in client files which will be kept by us for a minimum of 7 years.
            Access to your Personal Information
            You may access the Personal Information we hold about you and to update and/or correct it, subject to
            certain exceptions. If you wish to access your Personal Information, please contact us in writing.
            Energ4living will not charge any fee for your access request but may charge an administrative fee for
            providing a copy of your Personal Information.
            In order to protect your Personal Information, we may require identification from you before releasing the
            requested information.
            Maintaining the Quality of your Personal Information
            It is an important to us that your Personal Information is up to date. We will take reasonable steps to make
            sure that your Personal Information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you find that the information
            we have is not up to date or is inaccurate, please advise us as soon as practicable so we can update our
            records and ensure we can continue to provide quality services to you.
